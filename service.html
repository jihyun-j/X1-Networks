        <p>
          Build both web-based and mobile apps available to anyone in the
          enterprise. Apps can be designed to gather information (like online
          forms), to present information (such as an Amazon-like catalog), or to
          be interactive (like a Chat Bot).

          Build cross-application workflows that operate both with Microsoft
          applications and applications from hundreds of other manufacturers.
          For instance, a workflow could start in Outlook, then gather
          information from Salesforce, and then populate that information on a
          SharePoint page.
